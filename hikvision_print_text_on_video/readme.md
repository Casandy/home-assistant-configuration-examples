# Print custom text on Hikvision camera video

With this option it becomes possible to print custom text on the live video of the newer Hikvision cameras (models supporting ISAPI integration).
Two examples included, one which updates outdoor temperatures, and one which displays a message on the video when somebody pushes the doorbell button.

Tested and working with DS-2CD2T47G1-L firmare v5.6.5.
